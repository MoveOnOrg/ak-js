## form_prefill.js

Pre-fills form elements with values from query string, matching input name. ActionKit does this by automatically on some fields, but not all.

## error_catch.js

Saves errors to a variable, which can then be read by tools like Selenium.

## randomize.js

Uses "randomize-options" and "option" classes to randomize the order of elements in groups. Useful to avoid order bias in survey results.
